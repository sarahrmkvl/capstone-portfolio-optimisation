# Python Capstone Project – Portfolio Analysis & Optimisation

This project explores portfolio construction, risk analysis and data visualisation using Python and financial market data.

## 🚧 Project Status

This project is currently a work in progress.

Some parts of the code are still being refined, improved, and expanded as I continue learning and exploring new approaches. Certain sections remain incomplete and will be updated progressively, particularly regarding optimisation methods and additional analysis.

The repository reflects my ongoing learning process and will be regularly modified and enriched over time.

## Project Objectives
- Analyse stock price data
- Visualise performance through charts
- Explore basic portfolio optimisation concepts
- Develop practical Python skills applied to finance

## Tools Used
- Python
